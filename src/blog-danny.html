        <h1 id='page-title'>Q&A with 'The Chancer' Danny Sull</h1>

        <p>… making his debut to the blog and fighting out of Lanesborough, County Longford, Ireland, we have Danny joining MCW for a Q&A.</p>
        <p>I met young Danny about 4 years ago travelling through Vietnam. It took us 2 weeks to find out we were both big wrestling fans, and I fear we wouldn’t have if we weren’t on the road to Wrestlemania at the time. Excited at meeting another fan, we bet a dinner on who could predict the most Mania card results. I’ve not actually seen him in the flesh since leaving Vietnam but every year we bet the Mania card. I’ve lost the past few years so I’m owed about 20 chops as my punishment when I next go over to Ireland.</p>
        <p>From one mark to another, welcome to the blog…</p>

        <h4 class="question">Q: First off, I need a gimmicked wrestling name from you that you’ll be known as from now on.</h4>

        <p>"The Chancer" Danny Sull</p>

        <h4 class="question">Q: As someone who’s half Irish myself - I’ve noticed two things that seem more popular in Irish pop culture than English are wrestling and The Simpsons. Is that fair or have I made a massive sweeping statement?</h4>

        <p>The Simpsons was a show that the whole family would watch every day for a lot of households. It was on at 6pm every evening. So the kids would have finished their dinner and the parents would be home from work, so it was always watched as a unit. As for wrestling, I think Irish people tend to get very invested in things. We're quite passionate as people, so I think when we take an interest, we take a serious interest. Maybe that's why wrestling is popular here. We also love a scrap so there's that. But I remember even my dad who's not a wrestling fan talking about when Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy and the Dynamite Kid came to town when he was young and he went to see these giants of men. Wrestling is such a spectacle and who doesn't love a spectacle. </p>

        <h4 class="question">Q: Any early memories of what got you into wrestling?</h4>

        <p>We didn't have many channels growing up, so my earliest memory of wrestling was going over to my cousin's house and watching Jeff hardy doing crazy shit on Channel 4 or watching them on sky one on a Sunday morning. I think I even made my dad buy Royal Rumble '01 on dvd for me because I was just obsessed with the things they would do.</p>

        <h4 class="question">Q: Has there been a spell where you’ve felt you’ve lost interest in wrestling? If so, can you pinpoint a reason why?</h4>

        <p>Most definitely, I think every adult fan has a little bit of a period where they fall out of love with it. I think mine came maybe just after the whole Chris Benoit tragedy. I had no investment in any top guy and my other interests were taking over. I would see TNA come up on TV then and watch it occasionally but not with the same love I once had for it.</p>

        <h4 class="question">Q: Favourite wrestlers</h4>

        <p>AJ Styles: he is a main why I fell back in love with wrestling. It's unquantifiable how many excellent matches that guy has had. Also I've been a fan for most of his career so to see his progression to now is incredible.</p>
        <p>Samoa Joe: Other than being totally believable as a vicious, violent man, that sequence where a guy will springboard off something and he just walks away and faces the hard cam. I mark out everytime. It makes so much sense and it brings realism to an otherwise unrealistic sport.</p>
        <p>HBK: He is just a sexy boy ( Sexy boooooy ). One of the greatest storytellers whether it be on the microphone or with his body. He always made you feel something. You always watched a Michaels match. </p>

        <h4 class="question">Q: Favourite finishers</h4> 

        <p>Gringo Killa: it's just so so nasty looking.</p>
        <p>Superkick: simple but always looks so good.</p>
        <p>Cutter/RKO: again so simple but it just looks so good, and so many variations of it too.</p>

        <h4 class="question">Q: Favourite matches</h4> 

        <p>HBK v Ric Flair: "I'm sorry, I love you". A tale of an old dog being put out to pasture and him not wanting to go. A match of lament and acquiesce. A great match.</p>
        <p>Styles v Daniels v Joe: Unbreakable 2005. TNA's only 5 star match. An absolute perfect display of why TNA was so so watchable in the early days. 3 amazing young guys just putting on a world class display. And the storyline was there too. An unbeaten Samoa Joe. A desperate champion in Daniels. And the mega baby-face AJ Styles.</p>
        <p>Dudley's v Hardy boys v Edge & Christian: Jeff Hardy being speared off the belts while hanging is one of the single greatest moments in wrestling history. And one of my earliest memories of wrestling. It was so exciting and I had never seen anything so mental that was actually real life before.</p>

        <h4 class="question">Q: Favourite entrance</h4>
        
        <p>The fiend: it's just pure cinema and the slow walk really pumped you up with excitement.</p>
        <p>HBK: the music, the dancing, the crowd, the fireworks. Just class.</p>
        <p>Edge: I always like edges entrance. With the smoke and how pumped up he is. But what truly makes it amazing was his royal rumble return. Better than Bryan Danielson's return, better than the Hardy's return. Just so hyped.</p>

        <h4 class="question">Q: Can you construct your dream card of 4 matches? Can be any wrestlers from any era with any match gimmick.</h4>

        <p>Darby Allen & Jeff Hardy VS Will Ospreay & Rey Fenix (TLC match)</p>
        <p>Walter VS Jon Moxley (two out of three falls match)</p>
        <p>Eddie Guerrero VS Bryan Danielson (singles match)</p>
        <p>Finn Balor VS Jordan Devlin VS Fit Finlay VS Seamus VS David Finlay VS Becky Lynch (Elimination Chamber - match winner becomes the king of Ireland)</p>

        <h4 class="question">Q: In keeping with the spirit of the blog, who is your favourite mid-card wrestler?</h4>

        <p>I love anything Kevin Owens does. I think it's kind of cheating to say he's mid-card because he kind of goes up and down from the big belt picture. But face, heel, top or bottom of the card, I'm watching everything he does.</p>

        <h4 class="question">Q: If you could make one big change to improve wrestling today, what would it be?</h4>

        <p>I think AEW made fantastic changes to wrestling's culture when they started up. Between being able to work for other promotions and having time off so that characters don't get stale etc. I think if I was to change one thing I would try and bring better story writers in. I think wrestlers can do so much with the stuff they've got but I think alot of the story's being pitched to them are repetitive and stale.</p>

        <h4 class="question">Q: Finally, who do you think will be the next wave of top guys for the next 10 years?</h4>

        <p>I honestly think AEW have the two biggest currently.</p>
