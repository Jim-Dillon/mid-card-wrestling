                <p>Hangman v Omega is the greatest wrestling build I’ve ever seen. I love everything about this two-year storyline, it’s wrestling perfection. Outside Interference has very impressively chronicled the entirety of this feud, with its roots embedded in AEW's inception, culminating in Hangman’s victory at Full Gear 2021.</p>

                    <p>This is a wrestler reaching for the hot tag. You build to a hot tag by repeatedly preventing the illegal man from tagging in while his partner is being beaten down.
